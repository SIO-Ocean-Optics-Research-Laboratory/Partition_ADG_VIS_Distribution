# Partition_ADG_VIS_Distribution
---

The ADG partitioning model separates the non-phytoplankton absorption coefficient, a<sub>dg</sub>, into the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient, a<sub>g</sub>(λ), and non-algal (depigmented) particulate absorption coefficient, a<sub>d</sub>. The model partitions an input spectrum of a<sub>dg</sub>(λ) using predefined libraries of spectral shape functions for a<sub>d</sub> and a<sub>g</sub>. This version of the model is configured for use in the visible spectral range (VIS, 400 to 700 nm) and utilizes spectral shape libraries specifically defined for this spectral range. The complete development and validation of the ADG partitioning model will be described in [Kehrli et al., in preparation]. The model source code is in MATLAB file format.

This README document provides information about the files within the Partition_ADG_VIS_Distribution repository.

## Partition_ADG_VIS.m:
MATLAB function implementing the ADG partitioning model to partition input a<sub>dg</sub>(λ) into a<sub>g</sub>(λ) and a<sub>d</sub>(λ) using predefined libraries of spectral shape functions defined in the VIS. Returns output wavelength (lambda_out), a<sub>d</sub>(λ) (adopt), and a<sub>g</sub>(λ) (agopt). See supporting documentation for further details.

## Partition_ADG_VIS_Test.m:
MATLAB script that executes Partition_ADG_VIS.m on one sample input of spectral a<sub>dg</sub>(λ) defined from 400 to 700 nm in 1 nm intervals. The code implements the model with the predefined VIS spectral shape function libraries to partition input a<sub>dg</sub>(λ) into a<sub>g</sub>(λ) and a<sub>d</sub>(λ) from 400 to 700 nm in 1 nm intervals.

## Partition_ADG_VIS_Test_Run.xls:
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing the input and resulting output data obtained from the application of the Partition_ADG_VIS.m on one sample input of a<sub>dg</sub>(λ) to estimate a<sub>g</sub>(λ) and a<sub>d</sub>(λ). The file is the original output file generated by Partition_ADG_VIS_Test.m.

## VIS_lib.mat:
MATLAB file containing the libraries of spectral shape functions defined in the visible spectral region (from 400 to 700 nm with a 1 nm spectral interval). See the supporting publication (in preparation) for further details about the formation of the library.
